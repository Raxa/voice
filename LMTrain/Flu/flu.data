FLU+ Not sure if you're coming down with a cold, the flu or just one of those 24-hour flu bugs that leaves you feeling nauseated
FLU+ Well, first off, that 24-hour bug isn't the flu at all. 
FLU+If it has kicked you in the gut, you probably have viral gastroenteritis an infection caused by a variety of viruses that results in vomiting or diarrhea. 
FLU+ It is often called the stomach flu even though it's not caused by any of the influenza viruses.
FLU+ A cold and the flu share some of the same symptoms. 
FLU+ But even a bad cold is pretty mild, compared to a bout with the flu.
FLU+ No pill or herb will get rid of either each is caused by viruses and antibiotics, herbal remedies and homeopathic medicines are useless against them. You can take things that might ease your symptoms, but there is no cure.
FLU+ A cold usually comes on gradually over the course of a day or two. 
FLU+ Generally, it leaves you feeling tired, sneezing, coughing and plagued by a running nose. 
FLU+ You often don't have a fever, but when you do, it's only slightly higher than normal. 
FLU+ Colds usually last three to four days, but can hang around for 10 days to two weeks.
FLU+ Flu, on the other hand, comes on suddenly and hits hard. 
FLU+ You will feel weak and tired and you could run a fever as high as 40 C. 
FLU+ Your muscles and joints will probably ache, you will feel chilled and could have a severe headache and sore throat. 
FLU+ Getting off the couch or out of bed will be a chore. 
FLU+ The fever may last three to five days, but you could feel weak and tired for two to three weeks.
FLU+ Fever Occasional Often above 38.5 C for 2 to 4 days
FLU+ Headache Frequent, but not severe Prominent and often severe
FLU+ Aches pains Slight Often severe
FLU+ Fatigue weakness Mild Can last 2-3 weeks
FLU+ Extreme exhaustion Never Early and prominent
FLU+ Stuffy nose Common Occasional
FLU+ Sore throat Common Occasional
FLU+ Cough	Hacking	Can be severe
FLU+ Chest discomfort Mild to moderate Common, can become severe
FLU+ Onset Gradual develops over a day or two Sudden (within a few hours)
FLU+ Cause 200 strains of cold virus 3 strains of influenza virus
FLU+ The flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses but they are caused by different viruses. 
FLU+ Because these two types of illnesses have similar flu-like symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. 
FLU+ In general, the flu is worse than the common cold, and symptoms such as fever, body aches, extreme tiredness, and dry cough are more common and intense. 
FLU+ Colds are usually milder than the flu. 
FLU+ People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. 
FLU+ Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations.
FLU+ Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult (or even impossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. 
FLU+ Special tests that usually must be done within the first few days of illness can be carried out, when needed to tell if a person has the flu.
FLU+ Knowing the difference between the cold and flu can be tricky, but it doesn't have to be. 
FLU+ If you know what to look for, you can usually tell if you have a cold or a flu as soon as you notice symptoms.
FLU+ It is especially important to recognize the symptoms of the flu and notify your doctor within the first 24 hours. 
FLU+ If you can take Tamiflu or another antiviral flu medication within 48 hours of the start of symptoms, the flu may be shorter or less severe.
FLU- Gazel is a form of Turkish music that has almost died out. 
FLU-  While in other parts of the Central Asian world, gazel is synonymous with ghazal, in Turkey it denotes an improvised form of solo singing that is sometimes accompanied by the ney, ud, or tanbur. 
FLU- It is the vocal equivalent to the Turkish taqsim, an improvised instrumental composition.
FLU- Simba is a fictional character and the protagonist of Walt Disney Pictures' thirty-second animated feature film The Lion King (1994).
FLU- He subsequently appears as a supporting character in the film's direct-to-video sequel, The Lion King II Simba's Pride (1998), and direct-to-video parallel, The Lion King 1½. 
FLU- In the first film, Simba's speaking voice is provided by Matthew Broderick as an adult and Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a cub, while his singing voices are provided by Joseph Williams and Jason Weaver, respectively.
FLU- So, naturally you will need some access to many pre-classified events to train your model. 
FLU- The class opennlp.tools.doccat.DocumentSample encapsulates a text document and its classification. 
FLU- Document Sample has two constructors. 
FLU- Each take the text's category as one argument. 
FLU- The other argument can either be raw text, or an array of tokens. 
FLU- By default, the raw text will be split into tokens by whitespace. 
FLU- So, let's say your training data was contained in a text file, where the format is as described above. 
FLU- HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells.
FLU- HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through three main mechanisms: First, direct viral killing of infected cells; second, increased rates of apoptosis in infected cells; and third, killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. 
FLU- When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.
FLU- Some women with BV don't know they have it because they have no symptoms.
FLU- Women who have never had sexual intercourse may also be affected by BV, and it is common in pregnant women.
FLU- Having BV can increase a woman's susceptibility to other STDs. Pregnant women may deliver premature or low birth-weight babies.
FLU- The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention.
FLU- Initial manifestations of the disease common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as septicemia, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. 
FLU- The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, arthralgia (joint pain), vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobinuria, retinal damage, and convulsions. 
FLU- Approximately 30% of people however will no longer have a fever upon presenting to a health care facility. 
FLU- Owing to the non-specific nature of disease presentation, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic countries requires a high degree of suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), fever without localizing signs, thrombocytopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia combined with a normal peripheral blood leukocyte count.
FLU- The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by rigor and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days in P. vivax and P. ovale infections, and every three days (tertian fever) for P. malariae. P. falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours (quartan fever) or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.
